# Convex-Optimization
Optimization Problems solved using Julia
The code provided are solutions for some of the problems that I solved during the course taken Texas A&M. 
Course was on Convex Optimization for Control Systems taught by 
[Swaroop Darbha](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/darbha-swaroop.html). I took this course during Fall 2019.
Some files require all old version of Julia

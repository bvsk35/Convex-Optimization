# Convex-Optimization
Optimization Problems solved using Julia
The code provided are solutions for some of the problems that I solved during the course taken Texas A&M. 
Course was on Convex Optimization for Control Systems taught by 
[Swaroop Darbha](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/darbha-swaroop.html). I took this course during Fall 2019.
Some files require all old version of Julia.
- In `Basics of Julia` folder I have simple code to show how to use Julia (ex: simple syntax etc.) and how to solve a simple Linear Programming problem.
- In `Exam` folder I have Julia code to solve problems which more advanced with Seconder Conic Constraints (SOCP) and Semi-Definite programs (SDP).
- In `Project` folder I have important files required for the project and the paper on which the project was based on.
